# Not-so-simple-js-app
## Welcome to my Pokedex!
This is my first application connecting an API, using javascript + jquerry + bootstrap, and learning the practice of patience while coding.

Things I need to add:
1) A brief description of the project. You can use the project brief or README file as inspiration. In your description, try also to reflect on your work by answering the following questions (you don't need too much detail; the key points are fine):
- What was your role for this project and what tasks did you face?
- What decisions did you take and why? What were the consequences?
- If you could, what would you do differently?
- What lessons did you learn during this project?
2) A screenshot to represent the project.
3) A link to the project’s GitHub repository.
4) A link to the live, hosted version of your app (if possible). If you don’t have a live version, include screenshots that show the app’s functionality or a recording of your app in use.
5) A list of the technologies used for each project (React, CSS etc. — again, you can pull this from your README file).
6) Any other relevant materials you created for the project; for example, user flows, user stories, and/or a Kanban board. Be sure to explain how you worked with these materials during the project.

Should incldue the PDF of the Project Brief (if I can find it).
