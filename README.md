As the sole developer for my very first coding project - I faced numerous challenges. I needed to learn how to set up my development environment, learn how to debug code, and learn how to make code work AND look somewhat good.

# Features and Requirements User Goals
Users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand. 

## Key Features
Load data from an external source (API)
View a list of items
On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item
Technical Requirements
Required:
* The app must load data from an external API; for instance, the Pokémon API.
* The app must display a list of items loaded from that API after the page is loaded.
* The app must enable the viewing of more details for a given list item (like a Pokémon) on
demand, such as when clicking on a list item.
* The app must have CSS styling.
* The JavaScript code must be formatted according to ESLint rules.
* The JavaScript code may be formatted via Prettier.
* The JavaScript code may be manually formatted.
* The app must use at least one additional complex UI pattern, such as a modal, for details or
touch interactions.
* The app may allow searching for items (e.g., searching for Pokémon).
* The app must not throw any errors when being used.
* The app should be deployed to a publicly accessible platform like GitHub Pages (you can
review how to do this in Intro to Frontend Development's Exercise 10: Code Quality, Testing, &
Web Hosting).
* The app must work in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Internet Explorer 11.
